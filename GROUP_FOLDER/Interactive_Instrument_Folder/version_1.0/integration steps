This is a procedure in integrating the code into the code

1. download a clone or zip file of all the code. OR . copy code from the github files into processing.

// In processing

2. Utilising the versions of the program that has been downloaded or copied into processing, implement/link your code to 
    the main_program files (input manager, state manager, main method) so that they can run altogether.
    
3. Do some maintenance: 
    - ensuring that the created display or object does not intefere with other parts of the program.
    - ensuring that there are no unecessary background processes running.
    - ensuring that you have not majorly damaged or altered other members code to also affect other group members.
    
//Uploading to GitHub
    
4. UPLOAD: NOTE DO NOT COPY OR UPLOAD THE ENTIRE CODE INTO THE RESPECTIVE GITHUB FILES (as this may affect changes made 
    already by other members.
    - if making changes on other members code, ONLY UPLOAD BITS OF CHANGED LINES OF CODE, DO NOT PASTE OR UPLOAD THE WHOLE 
      FILE. (again..may affect other members coded changes).
    - If made new files that do not exist in github, upload those files into the appropriate folder.
    - Ensure that you commit the changes.
    
5. Lastly make sure that you contact the group that you have made changes.
